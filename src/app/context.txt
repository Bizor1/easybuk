Web Application Context for AI Development

Application Name:
WorkLink Africa

Framework & Version:
Next.js 14.1.0 (Full-stack)

Application Purpose:
WorkLink Africa connects users across Africa with skilled professionals (e.g., carpenters, electricians, plumbers, cleaners, teachers, etc.) and healthcare providers (doctors, nurses) for both physical appointments and remote consultations. The platform bridges the service gap by offering verified, trusted, and convenient access to local and remote workers.

Platform Architecture:
This platform uses a three-interface structure:

1. **Client Front-End (Users who hire professionals)**

* Register/login as a client.
* Search skilled professionals by category, location, price, availability, and ratings.
* Book services directly with real-time calendar and time-slot integration.
* Prepay for services or use wallet credit.
* View previous bookings, manage upcoming appointments.
* Submit reviews and ratings after services.
* Receive SMS/email notifications and booking confirmations.
* Use secure chat after booking to communicate with service providers.

2. **Jobseeker/Service Provider Front-End (Professionals)**

* Register/login and complete profile (bio, certifications, portfolio, hourly rate, location).
* Upload verification documents (ID, license).
* Set working hours and availability calendar.
* Receive and manage booking requests.
* Video appointment integration for remote consultations.
* Dashboard to track earnings, job history, and upcoming tasks.
* In-app messaging system (available after booking).
* Receive client reviews; profile visibility affected by performance.
* Funds held in escrow and released upon confirmed completion.

3. **Admin Dashboard (Platform Control Interface)**

3. Booking System:
